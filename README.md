## Bio

I'm **Kenneth Hoste**, a.k.a. '`boegel`', a computer scientist and FOSS enthusiast from Belgium. I have a Masters (2005) and PhD (2010) in Computer Science from Ghent University. My dissertation topic was "Analysis, Estimation and Optimization of Computer System Performance Using Machine Learning".

Since October 2010, I'm a member of the [HPC team at Ghent University (Belgium)](https://www.ugent.be/hpc/) where I am mainly responsible for user support & training. As a part of my job, I am also the lead developer and release manager of [EasyBuild](https://easybuilders.github.io/easybuild/), a software build and installation framework for (scientific) software on High Performance Computing (HPC) systems.

In my free time, I am a family guy and a fan of loud music, frequently attending gigs and festivals.

I enjoy helping people & sharing his expertise, and like joking around. I have a weak spot for stickers and beer.

Things I don't like include [CMake](https://cmake.org/), [Bazel](https://bazel.build/), [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org/), [C++](https://isocpp.org/), ...
